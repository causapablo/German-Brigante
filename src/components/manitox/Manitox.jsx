                    German Brigante has reached a total freedom in terms of creation. The main result of this is his own record label, Manitox. A place conceived since its inception as the ideal platform, where not only is it shown in the most personal way possible, with productions such as 'Marimba'. This is also the place where he is giving the opportunity to newcomers to show their skills. Artists,  in addition to already established names, that we will surely hear about them in the future.
